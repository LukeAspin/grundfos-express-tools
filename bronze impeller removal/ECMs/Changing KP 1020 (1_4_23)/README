Discovered that that ID from the Product associated with 1020-3/4 carries through to every instance in the database. So I can easily describe all instances in the CKB
with four distinct patters and they are shown below:

These 3 can be changed as follows:

1020-3/4 -> 1020-5/6
1020-3/4 KP -> 1020-5/6 KP
1020-3_4-KP -> 1020-5_6-KP

The Fourth is not quite as easy 

Desc-1020-3_4-KP_4 -> REGEX = Desc-1020-3_4-KP_(3|4)
